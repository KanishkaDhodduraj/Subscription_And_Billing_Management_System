# Subscription And Billing Management System

This is a Java backend project for managing subscriptions and billing.  
I am building this project step by step as part of my backend development learning.

## Project Goal

- Create and manage subscription plans  
- Calculate bills with discount and tax  
- Assign users to plans  
- Handle renewals and expired subscriptions  
- Later connect with MySQL database and expose APIs

## Current Status

Right now I am working on the basic Java part of the project.  
I have started with simple console programs to:

- Calculate subscription bill amounts using variables and operators  
- Create basic subscription plans in the console  
- Organize the project structure for future modules

I will keep improving this project as I learn more Java concepts like:

- Control flow statements  
- Arrays, strings, and regex  
- Object Oriented Programming (OOPs)  
- Collections, exceptions, and file handling  
- JDBC, MySQL, servlets, and Spring framework

## Technologies

- Java  
- IntelliJ IDEA  
- Git & GitHub  
- (Planned) MySQL, JDBC, Servlets, Springboot

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KanishkaDhodduraj/Subscription_And_Billing_Management_System.git
